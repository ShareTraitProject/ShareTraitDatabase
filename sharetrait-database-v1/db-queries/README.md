# Queries used for ShareTrait database version 1.0.0

## Description

In this folder you will find a list of questions translated into queries. For each question, we provide 3 types (i.e. 3 formatsof linked files that belong to the same file name:
- `query-name.md` : contains question and query template
- `query-name.sql` : contains the sql format query corresponding to the query view. This sql file can be executed on your local version of the database that you have previously imported locally. Please read the description below for learning how to execute these files.
- `query-name-output.csv` : copy of the query output loaded in a csv file.

> [!NOTE] 
The list of queries in this folder are already included as Views in the db version database [db-export](https://github.com/ShareTraitProject/ShareTraitDatabase/tree/main/sharetrait-database-v1/db-export), thus you do not have to add them in the database, but you can select * from view name already
