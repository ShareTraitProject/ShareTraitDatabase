## options for using ShareTrait db

ShareTrait (ST) database is a SQLite 3 version and in this document we provide ways for you to use the database names ST_all.db version 1.0. 
The first option is by importing the current version in a [SQLiteStudio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/about/), a friendly desktop application for browsing and editing SQLite database files. 

# How to access the db 
1. [by using SQLiteStudio](#sqlitestudio)

## sqlitestudio

1. Download
   - Go to the folder [db-export](https://github.com/ShareTraitProject/ShareTraitDatabase/blob/main/sharatrait-database-v1/db-export/) and download the ShareTrait (ST) database version 1.0 **ST_all.db**. The download icon is found on the top left corner of the raw data window, labelled as *Download raw file*. This option will download your databse (.db) file in the local Download folder. Please store this file in a home folder. Keep track of the path of that folder.
   - Download SQLiteStudio via the [download page](https://sqlitestudio.pl). This page contains the versions and applications that run on Windows, Linux and Mac operating systems. The SQLiteStudio is made easy and friendly and it only needs to click and run, without the need of configuring and installing it
     
2. Add and use the database
   - Open SQLiteStudio application desktop and from the top right browser menu **Database** select **Add a database**. This option will open a window in which you are able to provide the path of where the database or the database version (with .db extension) is located. You have also the possibility to search the folder directory *Select new or existing file on local computer*. Make sure that the *Database type* is kept with the type default setting to **SQLite 3**
  
3. Use database version 1.0 

   - Once you have imported the database in Studio, it can be viewed on the left window section containing the database Name List. Click on the name you recognise once. This will then allow to display the complete list of tables populated and ready to be used. This list of tables correspond to the complete table list in csv format provided in [db-tables](https://github.com/ShareTraitProject/ShareTraitDatabase/tree/main/sharatrait-database-v1/db-tables) folder.
   - You can click on each of the table to explore **Structure** of the table, **Data**, the values contained in the table, **Constraints**, **Indexes** and **Triggers** for technical set of rules in relation to the database and **DDL**, the data definition language commands used by SQL for creating and using commands with database objects.
     Please take a look at the well documented available manual on github for [SQLiteStudio User Manual](https://github.com/pawelsalawa/sqlitestudio/wiki/User_Manual).
